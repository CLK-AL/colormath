# Color conversions

This package allows you to convert between a number of color spaces. You
can convert from any supported color space to any other space.

## Supported color spaces

* RGB
* CMYK
* HSL
* HSV
* XYZ
* ANSI-16 color codes
* ANSI-256 color codes

Most conversions, including all conversions to and from RGB, run in a
single step. If there isn't a formula for a direct conversion between
two color spaces, the color will first be converted to RGB and then to
final color space.

## Usage

Each color space is represented with a data class, and contains
`.toXXX()` methods to convert to other spaces.

```kotlin
> RGB("#adcdef").toHSV()
HSV(h=211, s=28, v=94)

> RGB(12, 128, 255).toCMYK()
CMYK(c=95, m=50, y=0, k=0)

> HSL(180, 50, 50).toHex(withNumberSign = true)
"#40bfbf"
```

## Installation


```groovy
dependencies {
   compile 'com.github.ajalt:colorconvert:<latest version>'
}
